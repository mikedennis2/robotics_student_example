## Welcome to the CristoRey java project
#### The purpose of this project is to build on the student example we have been looking at.

### Setup:
1. Install Java, vs code, and then java extension pack
    - Using a chromebook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=302p0nTOZLU
    - Using a mac/windows PC: 
        1. Install java: https://www.java.com/en/download/
        2. Install Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com
        3. Install java extension pack (watch the end of the chromebook video, it is the same) 

2. Install git:
    - Using a windows PC: https://git-scm.com/download/win
    - Using a mac: https://git-scm.com/download/mac
    - Using a chromebook: https://www.techrepublic.com/videos/how-to-use-github-in-chrome-os/
        1. For those with chromebooks, we can do this together.

3. Install Github extension pack
    - In extensions section of vs code, search for "Github"
    - Test cloning a repo via vs code, will probably need an SSH key (We will do this together)
    - Clone this repository so we have our code to work with!
